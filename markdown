owerview of the project-
This project is a fundamental command line calculator,designed for simplicity n provides users with a clear menu to select standard arithmetic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division and handles basic error conditions,such as division by zero and invalid input types.The primary goal was to create a clean,single-file application that is easy to execute.

Development Process-
The calculator was developed using basic python
Separate, clear Python functions were used like add,subtract,multiply,divide were created to handle each calculation
while True loop was established to handle continuous operation which allowed the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the script.
logic was added to the divide function to check for a zero denominator and return a custom error message.
final lines of code allowed the user to decide whether to continue the loop or break it.

Future Improvements-
Support for More Operations like-modulus,exponents,square root,squares.
Allow users to input a full mathematical expression eg 5+3*(10-2)instead of requiring two numbers at a times
Implementing memory features M+,M-,MR to store and recall previous results.
transitioning from a console application to a simple GUI using python libraries
adding other basic calculator funtion and try adding scientific calculations.
